I spent the last few weeks trying to implement basic structure to create a renderer.
I made a attempt to create a basic library but my effort weren't focused as I am still learning the math and I am still trying to grasp the basic concepts of rendering.
I am able to make basic structure made of points and make a basic projection on a canvas.
Today I will try to make a basic rasterizer.
I learned more about matrix transforms.

I'm learning about rotation in the transform matrix. I beleive I can't really go any farter without learning about linear algebra or geometry in general. Then I will start by making a small rasterizer and move on to raytracing.

I did a couple of things with the vetor rotation matrices. But I've learned about a issues with floating point numbers. They are hard to work with and it forces me to be smarter in the way I build my tests.

I've decided that it would be easier to simply render the vector on screen to see if my transformations works.
I understand how rotations matrices work. The next thing should be quaternion.

I almost finished the scratchapixel geometry lessons. I've made a small rotation animation to test my knowledge so far. I also added the Sperical coordinate functions and stuctures.
